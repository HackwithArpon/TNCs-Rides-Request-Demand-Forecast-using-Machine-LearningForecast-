# TNCs-Rides-Request-Demand-Forecast-using-Machine-LearningForecast-

**ABSTRACT:**

From telling the taxi-driver where to go, to tell him where to come we have grown up. The market shares and significance of ride-hailing or Transportation Network Companies(TNCs) like Uber, Lyft, inDrive, OLA and Rapido are growing in numerous transportation markets. In this project, we'll develop a model using data from Uber, leading ride-hailing service in Kolkata, to estimate the gap between rider demands as well as driver supply in a particular location and time period. The data set used in this study was a ride request dataset. This dataset would have the following attributes: ride booking time, pickup location, and drop point latitude-longitude. The number of data points related to ride requests are, the columns of the data are Id of the customer, timestamp booking, pickup latitude, pickup longitude, drop latitude and drop longitude. On the phone-based Uber application, a passenger "calls a ride," (makes a request) by inputting the point of origin and destination and tapping the Request Pickup button.

**Introduction**

If you had used TNCs app some times then you must have paid some day less and someday more for the same journey or location. But have you ever thought what is the reason behind it? It is because of the high demand at some hours. This is not the only factor but this is one of them.
